# [Responsive-Portfolio](https://supercarboy88.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/)


## About

This is Responsive Portfolio Project, based on our last Basic Portfolio.
I use three `@media screen` tags, each with one of these `max-width`s: `980px`, `768px` and `640px`. Therefore, my portfolio will properly show in a different device, such as a mobile phone or a tablet.
